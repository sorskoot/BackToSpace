# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this


overall:
    ✔ Setup build pipelines @done(19-08-23 17:20)
gameplay:
    ✔ loose the game @done(19-08-26 23:52)
    invaders:
        ✔ spawn invaders @done(19-08-23 00:06)
            at 90 degrees width in front of the player, far away and up in the sky
            (0,50,(50 +/-45deg))
        ✔ move invaders towards player @done(19-08-23 00:16)
        ☐ create waves of invaders
    Shooting:
        ☐ keep track of score, how many invaders did you shoot.
        ☐ add a bounding box for the player that could get hit
        shoot invaders:
            ✔ bullets should be flying towards where the player looks @done(19-08-26 00:33)
            ✔ Actually hit invaders @done(19-08-26 23:15)
            controls:
                ✔ PC => tapping space @done(19-08-26 00:33)
                ☐ Mobile => tapping screen (bluetooth gun?)
                ☐ Daydream => remote
                ☐ Rift => controller
    controls:
        ☐ might need to add component to hide/show stuff depending on device/headset
        ☐ additional to this, we need to apply different components and setting based on formfactor
            - Figure out a way to detect the device. ==> AFRAME.utils.device
        look around:
            ✔ PC => mouse, if possible without dragging (look-controls="pointerLockEnabled:true") @done(19-08-24 22:56)
            ☐ Mobile => Gyro
            ☐ Daydream, Rift => native
        Fire:
            ✔ PC => hit space @done(19-08-26 00:33)
            ☐ Mobile => tap center @
            ☐ others => controller
        duck:
            ☐ PC => pressing A or D to duck left or right
            ☐ Mobile => touching left or right on the screen
            ☐ Daydream => controller
            ☐ Rift => just stand behind it
    mobile:
        ☐ full screen goes into splitscreen, is this preventable?

design:
    ☐ generate synthwave environment with 3d mountains, typical setting sun and grid on the ground. 
    ✔ Create design for aliens @done(19-09-01 21:07)
    ☐ Add more different invaders
    ☐ animate explosions
    ☐ design and animate rockets with fire and smoke
    ☐ Title screen
    ☐ Gameover screen

Optimizations:
    ☐ @low Optimize shaders
    ☐ @high use instancing for models
    ☐ @high restructure duplicate code with shaders and materials over components

Could haves / Would likes /:
    ☐ add spacial sound and invaders all around
    ☐ Easter eggs? by adding certain text url
    ☐ Cheats => by adding certain text url
        cheats:
            ☐ Godmode is added
