# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this

Could haves / Would likes /:
    ☐ @low add spacial sound and invaders all around
    ☐ @low Easter eggs? by adding certain text url

# ideas and random stuff
- have one invader break formation every now and then, just increase the speed by much.
- there are some WebVR examples of three.js
