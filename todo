# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this


overall:
    ✔ Setup build pipelines @done(19-08-23 17:20)
gameplay:
    ✔ loose the game @done(19-08-26 23:52)
    invaders:
        ✔ spawn invaders @done(19-08-23 00:06)
            at 90 degrees width in front of the player, far away and up in the sky
            (0,50,(50 +/-45deg))
        ✔ move invaders towards player @done(19-08-23 00:16)
        ✔ @critical create waves of invaders @done(19-09-02 00:11)
        ✔ @critical Add 'AI' to invaders so they move from left to right, slowly getting closer. @done(19-09-02 23:04)
        ☐ @low Every now and then an invader breaks formation and takes its own path.
        ☐ @critical Create a new wave after every invader is shot
        ☐ @high Have the aliens shoot a missile every now and than.
        ✔ @low invaders in different colors @done(19-09-02 00:12)
        ☐ @low Create animation when invaders appear
        ☐ @high Every wave the speed increases. Making it impossible to finish the game.
        ☐ @low At a certain interval a spaceship appears and fires missiles
        ☐ @low When a new wave is created, spawn all invaders at random positions in the distance and animate them into formation over a few seconds

    Shooting:
        ☐ @critical keep track of score, how many invaders did you shoot.
        ☐ @critical add a bounding box for the player that could get hit
        shoot invaders:
            ✔ bullets should be flying towards where the player looks @done(19-08-26 00:33)
            ✔ Actually hit invaders @done(19-08-26 23:15)
            controls:
                ✔ PC => tapping space @done(19-08-26 00:33)
                ☐ @high Mobile => tapping screen (bluetooth gun?)
                ✔ @high Daydream => remote @done(19-09-02 00:11)
                ☐ @high Rift => controller
    controls:
        ☐ @low might need to add component to hide/show stuff depending on device/headset
        ☐ @critical additional to this, we need to apply different components and setting based on formfactor
            To figure out how to detect the device. ==> AFRAME.utils.device
        look around:
            ✔ PC => mouse, if possible without dragging (look-controls="pointerLockEnabled:true") @done(19-08-24 22:56)
            ☐ @high Mobile => Gyro
            ✔ @high Daydream, Rift => native @done(19-09-02 00:11)
        Fire:
            ✔ PC => hit space @done(19-08-26 00:33)
            ☐ @high Mobile => tap center @
            @high others => controller:
                ✔ Daydream @done(19-09-02 00:11)
                ☐ Rift
        duck:
            ☐ @high PC => pressing A or D to duck left or right
            ☐ @high Mobile => touching left or right on the screen
            ☐ @high Daydream => controller
            ☐ @high Rift => just stand behind it
    mobile:
        ☐ @low full screen goes into splitscreen, is this preventable?

design:
    @high generate synthwave environment:
        ✔ ground @done(19-09-03 13:16)
        ✔ Sky @done(19-09-03 13:16)
        ☐ mountains
        ☐ sun

    ✔ Create design for aliens @done(19-09-01 21:07)
    ☐ @high Add more different invaders
    ☐ @low animate explosions
    ☐ @low design and animate rockets with fire and smoke
    ☐ @critical Title screen
    ☐ @critical Gameover screen

Optimizations:
    ☐ @low Optimize shaders
    ☐ @high use instancing for models
    ☐ @high restructure duplicate code with shaders and materials over components

bugs:
    ☐ @critical Hide 'gun' on desktop
    ✔ @critical missiles not firing in the right direction on desktop @done(19-09-03 13:17)

Could haves / Would likes /:
    ☐ @low add spacial sound and invaders all around
    ☐ @low Easter eggs? by adding certain text url
    ☐ @low Cheats => by adding certain text url
        cheats:
            ✔ `godmode` is added @done(19-09-01 22:08)
            ☐ @low `wave=X` to start at wave X
