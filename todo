# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this

            ☐ Remove Desktop version (for now)
                ~ Desktop is causing the most difficulties at the moment and most
                ~ people are not going to play it on desktop anyway. It should be back online
                ~ on HeyVR.io ASAP!

            Gameplay:

                ✔ Add score @done(23-08-13 11:12)
                ☐ Show score when game over
            ✔ Add SFX @done(23-08-11 23:14)

            ✔ Add Particles @done(23-08-12 23:10)
        @critical Current Bugs :
            ✔ Sometimes the missiles stop hittin, noticable when they are close @done(23-08-12 23:10)
                ~ In the previous version there was just a calculation of the distance between each alien and
                ~ each missile. If the two were close it was a hit. I wonder if that would be faster and 
                ~ easier than colliders.
            ✔ Start position of missile seems to be wrong, could be recycling of objects or something @done(23-08-12 23:10)
            ☐ Particles seem to still cause weirdness.
            ✔ @critical When shooting the aliens multiply exponentially @done(23-08-26 10:03)
          

        Should have:
            ☐ Animation on appearance of aliens
            ☐ Add scoreboard
        Could Have:
            Improvements:
                ☐ Current LOD shader can have a level between 0 and 1.
            Next version ideas:
                ☐ Swap gun between hands
                ☐ Particles when shooting
                ☐ more level
                ☐ more aliens
                ☐ Special things
                    ~ Like the UFO in the original game
        Would Like:
            ☐ bring desktop back
# V1.6
TODO:
    ✘ upgrade to latest A-Frame @cancelled(23-08-01 20:31)

# V1.5
Must have:
    ✔ Hud for showing score @done(20-10-18 12:34)
    ☐ More levels
    ✔ Replace title, game-over and 'press anykey' with image so they look the same on all devices @done(21-09-20 07:48)
    ✔ fix ground @done(20-10-17 10:36)

Should have:
    ✔ Integration with CA scoring @done(21-09-20 07:48)
    ☐ More different enemies
    ☐ better/more music
    ☐ show wave on Hud
    ☐ Change background with a tiling noise
    ☐ better looking explosions

Would Like:
    ☐ instancing in 3D models

overall:
    ☐ @high Add all the meta tags
    ☐ @low Add alarm sound for near collision, when you are about to die
gameplay:
    invaders:
        ☐ @low Have the aliens shoot a missile every now and than.
        ☐ @low At a certain interval a spaceship appears and fires missiles
        ☐ Invaders should fly in more interesting patterns all around you
    Shooting:
        ☐ @high show the score on screen
            Maybe at the side of the gun
        ☐ @low add a bounding box for the player that could get hit
        ☐ @high add a second gun when using the payment API
            https://webmonetization.org/docs/api
    controls:
        ☐ @low might need to add component to hide/show stuff depending on device/headset
        ☐ @high additional to this, we need to apply different components and setting based on formfactor
            To figure out how to detect the device. ==> AFRAME.utils.device
        duck: 
            # probably not going to implement ducking or missiles
            ☐ @low PC => pressing A or D to duck left or right
            ☐ @low Mobile => touching left or right on the screen
            ☐ @low Daydream => controller
            ☐ @low Rift => just stand behind it
    mobile:
        ☐ @low full screen goes into splitscreen, is this preventable?

design:
    ☐ @high Add more different invaders
    ☐ @low design and animate rockets with fire and smoke
    ☐ @low Add highest score (local storage) to gameover screen
    ☐ @low Glow/Bloom effect

Optimizations:
    ☐ @low Optimize shaders
    ☐ @low use instancing for models (won't fit in 13k)

bugs:
    ☐ @low Sometimes when all invaders are shot we don't get the next wave.(probably due to godmode)
    ☐ @low Glow on title text is cut off because text starts at Y 0
    ☐ @high Make rotations work on all devices.
    ☐ @high Bullets start above the gun in VR

Could haves / Would likes /:
    ☐ @low add spacial sound and invaders all around
    ☐ @high Easter eggs? by adding certain text url
        - konami code
    ☐ @low Cheats => by adding certain text url
        cheats:
            ☐ @low `wave=X` to start at wave X
