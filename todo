# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this


overall:
    - Setup build pipelines
    
gameplay:
    - spawn invaders
        at 90 degrees width in front of the player, far away and up in the sky
    - shoot invaders
        bullets should be flying towards the invaders
        PC => tapping space
        Mobile => tapping screen (bluetooth gun?)
        Daydream => remote
        Rift => controller
     - look around
        PC => mouse, if possible without dragging
        Mobile => Gyro
        Daydream, Right => native
    
design:
    - generate synthwave environment with 3d mountains, typical setting sun and grid on the ground.
