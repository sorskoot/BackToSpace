# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this

            controls:

                ☐ Mobile => tapping screen (bluetooth gun?)
                ☐ Daydream => remote

    controls:
        look around:
            ✔ PC => mouse, if possible without dragging (look-controls="pointerLockEnabled:true") @done(19-08-24 22:56)
            ☐ Mobile => Gyro

    mobile:
        ☐ full screen goes into splitscreen, is this preventable?

design:
    ☐ generate synthwave environment with 3d mountains, typical setting sun and grid on the ground. 
    ☐ Create design for aliens
    ☐ animate explosions
    ☐ design and animate rockets with fire and smoke
    
# ideas and random stuff
- there are some WebVR examples of three.js
- add spacial sound and invaders all around
- add a bounding box for the player that could get hit
- might need to add component to hide/show stuff depending on device/headset
    - additional to this, we need to apply different components and setting based on formfactor
- Figure out a way to detect the device. ==> AFRAME.utils.device
- keep track of score, how many invaders did you shoot.
- Title screen
- Gameover screen
- Easter eggs? by adding certain text url
- Cheats => by adding certain text url
