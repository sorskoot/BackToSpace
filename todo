# Idea - Back To Space 
# Space invaders in VR (Maybe AR)

# Scene - Synthwave 80s look

# First focus on gameplay on Desktop, Phone, Daydream and Rift
# Second make it look gorgeous

# the game should slowly become faster and invaders should start shooting back. 
# avoiding being shot will be hard on everywhere else then Rift. come up with a way to fix this


overall:
    ☐ Setup build pipelines
    
gameplay:
    invaders:
        ✔ spawn invaders @done(19-08-23 00:06)
            at 90 degrees width in front of the player, far away and up in the sky
            (0,50,(50 +/-45deg))
        ☐ move invaders towards player
        ☐ create waves of invaders
    Shooting:
        shoot invaders:
            ☐ bullets should be flying towards where the player looks
            controls:
                ☐ PC => tapping space
                ☐ Mobile => tapping screen (bluetooth gun?)
                ☐ Daydream => remote
                ☐ Rift => controller
    controls:
        look around:
            ☐ PC => mouse, if possible without dragging
            ☐ Mobile => Gyro
            ☐ Daydream, Rift => native
        duck:
            ☐ PC => pressing A or D to duck left or right
            ☐ Mobile => touching left or right on the screen
            ☐ Daydream => controller
            ☐ Rift => just stand behind it


design:
    ☐ generate synthwave environment with 3d mountains, typical setting sun and grid on the ground. 
    ☐ Create design for aliens
    ☐ animate explosions
    ☐ design and animate rockets with fire and smoke
    
# ideas and random stuff
- there are some WebVR examples of three.js
- add spacial sound and invaders all around
- add a bounding box for the player that could get hit
- might need to add component to hide/show stuff depending on device/headset
